Abstract
This Lead Scoring project aims to predict the likelihood of a lead converting into a customer by leveraging machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features associated with each lead, the project seeks to enhance the efficiency of the sales process, allowing businesses to focus their efforts on the most promising leads. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to identify key patterns and improve lead conversion rates.

Objective 
The primary objective of this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models to accurately predict lead conversion. The models will be trained on historical lead data, and the results will be used to score and prioritize leads, ultimately improving the efficiency and effectiveness of sales strategies.

Introduction
In the competitive business landscape, identifying and prioritizing potential customers is crucial for optimizing sales efforts. Lead scoring is a technique used to rank prospects against a scale representing the perceived value each lead represents to the organization. This project utilizes machine learning to automate the lead scoring process, providing a data-driven approach to predict which leads are most likely to convert into paying customers.

Steps
1.	Data Collection: Obtain the lead scoring dataset, which includes various features and the target variable indicating whether a lead converted.
2.	Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.
3.	Model Training: Train multiple machine learning models, including Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks, using the training dataset.
4.	Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models on the test dataset using accuracy scores and other relevant metrics to determine their performance.
5.	Visualization: Create visualizations such as line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms to understand the data distribution and model performance.
6.	Interpretation: Analyze the results and identify the most significant features contributing to lead conversion predictions.
7.	Conclusion: Summarize the findings and provide insights on how the model can be used to enhance the sales process.

Methodology:
The project utilized a comprehensive dataset that included various features related to leads, such as the lead source, total visits made, time spent on the website, and other demographic and behavioral attributes. Data preprocessing was a crucial step in preparing the data for modeling. For numerical features with missing values, the median value was imputed, while for categorical features, the mode value was used for imputation. Categorical variables were then converted into numerical representations using the one-hot encoding technique. To ensure that all features contributed equally to the model, numerical features were normalized using standard scaling.
The project employed three different machine learning models for training: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The Decision Tree model, known for its simplicity and interpretability, was utilized to understand the importance of features in the prediction process. The KNN model classified leads based on their similarity to other leads in the dataset. The MLP, a neural network model, was employed to capture complex patterns present in the data. Prior to model training, the dataset was split into training and testing sets, with an 80-20 split ratio. The models were trained on the training set, and their performance was evaluated on the testing set. Multiple evaluation metrics were used to measure the models' performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
To gain deeper insights into the data distributions, model performance over training epochs, and the relationships between features and the target variable, various visualizations were generated. These visualizations provided valuable information for interpreting the results and identifying the most significant features contributing to lead conversion predictions. 

Conclusion
The Lead Scoring project successfully developed and evaluated several machine learning models to predict lead conversion. The models demonstrated varying degrees of accuracy, with the Multi-Layer Perceptron showing the most promising results. Visualizations provided valuable insights into the data and model performance. Implementing these models can significantly enhance the efficiency of sales teams by allowing them to prioritize high-potential leads, ultimately improving conversion rates and business growth. Future work can involve refining the models with more data and exploring additional features to further improve predictive accuracy.
